# Mathematical_Modeling_Hindu_Philosophy
Mathematical models inspired by Hindu cosmology: Continuous (\(f(t)=\frac{t}{1+t}\)) shows Nirguna to Saguna; Discrete (\(A_n=2^{n-1}\)) depicts hierarchical growth to Anant; Limit-Based (\(\lim_{x\to\infty}(0+x^n)\)) unifies all. Code and visuals explore these divine concepts.
